        <p class="bold">Hi, I'm Nate üëã I currently lead the Product Design team at Tax Systems, helping to transform an established, industry-leading desktop product into a collaborative, dynamic cloud platform that delivers extended value to its growing user-base.</p>

        <p>With experience launching a successful product, managing my own small design agency, working in-house and as a contractor I have a diverse product design career that covers various industries, project types and methodologies.</p>

        <p>I've had the pleasure of working with some very talented design and development teams, in both a lead and management capacity; mentoring designers that have gone on to have exciting careers. I‚Äôm equally capable of working independently and have a broad product skillset that can carry a project from discovery to delivery, and beyond.</p>

        <p>Outside of my life-long fascination with design and psychology I‚Äôm also passionate about making music and art. When I‚Äôm not in the studio I like to spend as much time as possible outside enjoying nature.</p>

        <!--<p>I‚Äôm currently looking for a permanent role that allows for mutual long-term growth, in a business that‚Äôs excited about how a modern product process can empower their strategy and improve their relationship with their customers.</p>-->
